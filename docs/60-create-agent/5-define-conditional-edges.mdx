# 👐 Define conditional edges

Edges in a LangGraph graph can be fixed or conditional. For conditional edges, we need a routing function to conditionally route the workflow to different nodes.

Run the cells under the **Step 9: Define conditional edges** section in the notebook to define the routing function for the one conditional edge in our graph.

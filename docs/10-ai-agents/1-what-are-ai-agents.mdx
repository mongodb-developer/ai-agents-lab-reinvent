An AI agent is a system that uses an LLM to **reason** through a problem, create a **plan** to solve the problem, and **execute** the plan with the help of a set of tools.

In multi-agent systems, two or more agents collaborate or orchestrate and delegate tasks to solve problems.

This way, agentic systems can handle complex, multi-step queries, and also self-revise and refine responses.

# üèÅ Quick Start 

For the impatient AKA all of us

## Install Node

To use Docusaurus we need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Install npx

To clone this repo we'll use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

```shell
npm i npx
```

## Clone this repo
 
Clone this repo using `npx`, giving it the name of the workshop you want to write about

```shell
npx create-docusaurus@latest name-of-my-new-awesome-workshop https://github.com/mongodb-developer/docusaurus-workshop
```

## Remove .git directory

As right now `origin` is pointing to https://github.com/mongodb-developer/docusaurus-workshop and you don't want that. Also, most probably you don't want this git repo's history.

```shell
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version"
```

## Start it!

```shell
cd name-of-my-new-awesome-workshop
npm start
```

## Try it!

Everything going according to plan, your site should be available at `http://localhost:3000/name-of-my-new-awesome-workshop`

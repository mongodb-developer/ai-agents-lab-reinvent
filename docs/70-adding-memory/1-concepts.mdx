# ðŸ“˜ Concepts

Here is a quick overview of concepts that you will come across in this section of the lab:

## Checkpoints

Checkpoints in LangGraph are a snapshot of the graph state. This is how AI applications built using LangGraph persist short-term and long-term memory.

## Thread IDs
Thread IDs are unique IDs assigned to memory checkpoints in LangGraph, allowing it to distinguish between conversation threads, facilitate human-in-the loop workflows and allow users to review and debug graph executions.

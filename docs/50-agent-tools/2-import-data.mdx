# üëê Import data

The MongoDB learning assistant has two tools- a vector search tool to retrieve information to answer questions about MongoDB, and another tool to get the content of articles in our Developer Center for summarization.

Let's import the data required by these tools into two MongoDB collections. This is as simple as making a `GET` request to a serverless function that we have created for you.

Run the cells under the **Step 3: Import data** section in the notebook to import the data required by our agent's tools, into MongoDB collections.
